# Product Guardrails

Status: active
Owner: repo maintainers

## Rules

- Keep shared code generic and project-agnostic.
- Do not drag app-local composition back into Underlay just because several
  consumers currently share a pattern.
- Keep Underlay-owned runtime/client/pattern boundaries separate from
  Poodle-owned visible UI surfaces.
- Keep parallel generations genuinely independent when parallel mode is active.
- Do not use the Rust platform-contract transition as a pretext to move
  app-local behavior into Underlay without a stable reusable boundary.
- For the reference-grade reset, breaking changes are allowed only when they
  remove ambiguous shared surface and update affected consumers in the same
  lane.

## Next Task

Review `g10.002` from the active monorepo consumer-workspace spec. Keep
`g10.003` blocked until review and operator-authorized merge. Keep the
contract-and-guide normalization separate from conformance code, consumer edits,
and shared runtime or template extraction.
