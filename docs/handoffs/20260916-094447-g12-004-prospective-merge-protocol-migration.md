## What This Thread Was Doing

Apply Northstar g03.020's accepted Queue manifest migration to Underlay.

## Why It Matters

The prospective merge target checks the tree Queue will merge and avoids
reviewed-head refusals caused by newer base changes outside the lane.

## Current State

Underlay main is clean and synchronized. The installed migration dry-run
accepts its exact v3 manifest. Northstar g03.020 is terminal at `f34e1c0`.
Required sibling worktree links: none. Use the automatic economical pool;
frontier-worker justification: none.

## Boundaries

Change only `.paseo/queue.json` through the installed command. Do not change
Underlay runtime, dependencies, releases, CI, Queue state, product planning,
threads or workspaces.

## Important Context

Run `effigy skill run northstar/lifecycle:migrate-premerge` first, then the same
selector with `-- --write`. The only accepted edit is v3 to v4 plus
`reviewed_head` to `prospective_merge`. Refusals fail closed.

## Suggested Next Move

Verify the clean branch and committed handoff, run dry-run and write mode, then
inspect the complete diff before validation.

## Completion Protocol

Prove `applied`, then `unchanged` on replay, validate the v4 manifest, run the
focused docs/config checks and `git diff --check`. Commit and push one non-draft
PR, then report `ready_for_review` through the authenticated Queue callback.
Independent review uses another provider/model. Do not publish a release.
